Tuple Out Dice Game

Overview
The Tuple Out Dice Game is a turn-based dice game where players compete to score the most points by rolling dice strategically. Players must avoid “tupling out” (rolling three of the same number) while deciding whether to re-roll certain dice to improve their score. The game ends when a player reaches the target score (default: 50 points).

Features
Turn-based gameplay for multiple players
Dice are “fixed” when two show the same value and cannot be re-rolled
Players re-roll any non-fixed dice to improve their score
Rolling three of the same number (“tupling out”) ends the turn with zero points
The game tracks and displays running scores after each turn
The first player to reach the target score wins
